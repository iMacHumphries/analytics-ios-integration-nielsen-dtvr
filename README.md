# Segment Nielsen DTVR Integration

## Installation

The Nielsen App SDK as of version 6.0.0.0 is compatible with iOS 8.0 and above.

The Segment-Nielsen DTVR SDK is available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "Segment-Nielsen-DTVR"
```

The integration relies on the Nielsen App SDK framework, which can either be installed via CocoaPods or by manually adding the framework.
You will need to have a Nielsen representative before getting started.

### CocoaPods

When using the Nielsen SDK version 6.2.0.0 and above, Nielsen recommends installation via CocoaPods, and Apple recommends using the dynamic framework.

Requirements for CocoaPods:
Dynamic Framework - version 1.6.1 or higher
Static Framework - version 1.4.0 or higher

1. Set repository credentials
The first step is to add the credentials received from Nielsen into your .netrc file. Navigate to your home folder and create a file called .netrc
```
cd ~/
vi .netrc
```

Add the credentials in the following format:
```
machine raw.githubusercontent.com
login <Nielsen App SDK client>
password <Auth token>
```

You will need to fill out a license agreement form and have the contact information for your Nielsen representative in order to obtain the credentials [here](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/Special:Downloads)

2. Add the source to your Podfile:
Dynamic Framework - `source 'https://github.com/NielsenDigitalSDK/nielsenappsdk-ios-specs-dynamic.git'`
Note - you will also need to include `use_frameworks!`

Static Framework - `source 'https://github.com/NielsenDigitalSDK/nielsenappsdk-ios-specs.git'`

3. Add the pod to your Podfile:

`pod NielsenAppSDK`

There are several other pods available, and can be found in the [Nielsen Digital Measurement iOS Artifactory Guide](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/Digital_Measurement_iOS_Artifactory_Guide)

4. Install pods

`pod install`

The full instructions from Nielsen can be found [here](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/Digital_Measurement_iOS_Artifactory_Guide)

### Manual

Navigate to the [Nielsen Downloads](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/Special:Downloads) page to download the iOS SDK.
You will need to fill out a license agreement form and have the contact information for your Nielsen representative ready.

Once extracted, add the NielsenAppApi.framework to the project and ensure it's in the `Frameworks` folder, and that it is linked.

Nielsen also requires the following frameworks, which must be included into Link Binary with Libraries (within app targetâ€™s Build Phases)
  - AdSupport.framework
  - SystemConfiguration.framework
  - CoreLocation.framework (Not applicable for International (Germany))
  - libsqlite3

## Integration

`#import <Segment-Nielsen-DTVR/SEGNielsenDTVRIntegrationFactory.h>`

Then register the factory with the Segment SDK:

```
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];

[config use:[SEGNielsenDTVRIntegrationFactory instance]];

[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];
```
